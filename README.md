# Scraping-Data
In this article, we will scrap data from Zillow.com using the Python programing language. There are several libraries that can help us to do this but today we will start with request and Beautiful Soup.

Basically, the whole web scraping process is to send an HTTP request to the URL of the webpage that we want to get the data from, then the HTML content of the webpage will be returned. After creating a nested/tree structure of the HTML by a parser, we can start to navigate and search for the patterns that we are looking for.

 you can find the code in Zillow file.
